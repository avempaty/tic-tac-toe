This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This template is created to take advantage of running express.js but being able to build a fullstack application without having to run 2 servers to run both frontend and backend pieces.

## Getting Started

package.json contains a command "npm run server" to start the express server in the backend.
